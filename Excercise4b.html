 <i><pre> She left him with a broken heart 
He walks alone, confused.
Lost without her by his side
He softly sings the blues.
</pre></i></h2>
<h2 style="color:red;font-size:13pt;text-align:left ;font-family:Tahoma;">
 <u><pre>In the darkened stormy night
He sings his solemn tune.
Tears roll from his reddened eyes
As he strums, and drums, and croons.
</pre></u></h2>
<h2 style="color:green;font-size:15pt;text-align:center ;font-family:Chiller;">
 <b><i><pre>The joyful music he once had sang
Only causes him to weep.
He thinks of the love he once had,
And how he set her free.
</pre><b><i></h2>
<h2 style="color:orange;font-size:14pt;text-align:right;font-family:Harrington;">
 <u><i><pre>His fear of loss caused him to lose
The only love he's ever known, 
And now he has nowhere to go,
Her arms were once his home.
</pre><u><i></h2>
<h2 style="color:orange;font-size:14pt;text-align:center ;font-family: Forte;">
 <b><u><i><pre>So he strolls down an empty street
In search of a reason to hold on.
She is now his only muse,
And her memory is his song.
</pre><b><u><i></h2>
